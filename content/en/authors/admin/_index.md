Hello there! I'm Junichi Nagasawa. After journeying across seas as a member of the Japanese national sailing team, I dove into the world of Chinese language and worked in legal translation at a law firm. I was studying Information Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University on a full scholarship when COVID-19 led me back home, prompting my transfer to Kobe University. There, I delved into machine learning research related to eye movements in Human Interface Lab. Currently, I'm embracing new challenges as a contract researcher at Kwansei Gakuin University.
